Tip into the tart tin and, using the back of a spoon, press over the base and sides of the tin to give an even layer. Chill in the fridge while you make the filling.\r\nCream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. You can do this in a food processor if you have one. Process for 2-3 minutes. Mix in the eggs, then add the ground almonds and almond extract and blend until well combined.\r\nPeel the apples, and cut thin slices of apple. Do this at the last minute to prevent the apple going brown. Arrange the slices over the biscuit base. Spread the frangipane filling evenly on top. Level the surface and sprinkle with the flaked almonds.\r\nBake for 20-25 minutes until golden-brown and set.\r\nRemove from the oven and leave to cool for 15 minutes. Remove the sides of the tin. An easy way to do this is to stand the tin on a can of beans and push down gently on the edges of the tin.\r\nTransfer the tart, with the tin base attached, to a serving plate. Serve warm with cream, crème fraiche or ice cream.","strMealThumb":"https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/wxywrq1468235067.jpg","strTags":"Tart,Baking,Fruity","strYoutube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp8Slv4INLk","strIngredient1":"digestive biscuits","strIngredient2":"butter","strIngredient3":"Bramley apples","strIngredient4":"Salted Butter","strIngredient5":"caster sugar","strIngredient6":"free-range eggs, beaten","strIngredient7":"ground almonds","strIngredient8":"almond extract","strIngredient9":"flaked almonds","strIngredient10":"","strIngredient11":"","strIngredient12":"","strIngredient13":"","strIngredient14":"","strIngredient15":"","strIngredient16":null,"strIngredient17":null,"strIngredient18":null,"strIngredient19":null,"strIngredient20":null,"strMeasure1":"175g/6oz","strMeasure2":"75g/3oz","strMeasure3":"200g/7oz","strMeasure4":"75g/3oz","strMeasure5":"75g/3oz","strMeasure6":"2","strMeasure7":"75g/3oz","strMeasure8":"1 tsp","strMeasure9":"50g/1¾oz","strMeasure10":"","strMeasure11":"","strMeasure12":"","strMeasure13":"","strMeasure14":"","strMeasure15":"","strMeasure16":null,"strMeasure17":null,"strMeasure18":null,"strMeasure19":null,"strMeasure20":null,"strSource":null,"strImageSource":null,"strCreativeCommonsConfirmed":null,"dateModified":null},{"idMeal":"52893","strMeal":"Apple & Blackberry Crumble","strMealAlternate":null,"strCategory":"Dessert","strArea":"British","strInstructions":"Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5.

Small delicate leaves are better than the large bristly ones but, if only large leaves are to hand, then trim them to roughly 12 by 12 cms so that you don't get too many layers of leaves around the filling. And remove any stalks. Drain the preserved leaves, immerse them in boiling water for 10 minutes and then leave to dry on a tea towel before use. \r\nBasmati rice with butter and pine nuts is an ideal accompaniment. Couscous is great, too. Serves four.\r\nFirst make the filling. Put all the ingredients, apart from the tomatoes, in a bowl. Cut the tomatoes in half, coarsely grate into the bowl and discard the skins. Add half a teaspoon of salt and some black pepper, and stir. Leave on the side, or in the fridge, for up to a day. Before using, gently squeeze with your hands and drain away any juices that come out.\r\nTo make the sauce, heat the oil in a medium pan. Add the ginger and garlic, cook for a minute or two, taking care not to burn them, then add the tomato, lemon juice and sugar. Season, and simmer for 20 minutes.\r\nWhile the sauce is bubbling away, prepare the vine leaves. Use any torn or broken leaves to line the base of a wide, heavy saucepan. Trim any leaves from the fennel, cut it vertically into 0.5cm-thick slices and spread over the base of the pan to cover completely.\r\nLay a prepared vine leaf (see intro) on a work surface, veiny side up. Put two teaspoons of filling at the base of the leaf in a 2cm-long by 1cm-wide strip. Fold the sides of the leaf over the filling, then roll it tightly from bottom to top, in a cigar shape. Place in the pan, seam down, and repeat with the remaining leaves, placing them tightly next to each other in lines or circles (in two layers if necessary).\r\nPour the sauce over the leaves (and, if needed, add water just to cover). Place a plate on top, to weigh the leaves down, then cover with a lid. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and cook on a bare simmer for 70 minutes. Most of the liquid should evaporate. Remove from the heat, and leave to cool a little - they are best served warm. When serving, bring to the table in the pan - it looks great. Serve a few vine leaves and fennel slices with warm rice. Spoon the braising juices on top and garnish with coriander.","strMealThumb":"https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/qtwtss1468572261.jpg","strTags":"Sweet","strYoutube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaZb1MnFBgA","strIngredient1":"olive oil","strIngredient2":"ginger","strIngredient3":"garlic","strIngredient4":"tomatoes","strIngredient5":"lemon juice","strIngredient6":"caster sugar","strIngredient7":"vine leaves","strIngredient8":"fennel bulb","strIngredient9":"lamb mince","strIngredient10":"onion","strIngredient11":"potatoes","strIngredient12":"basmati rice","strIngredient13":"chopped parsley","strIngredient14":"coriander","strIngredient15":"lemon juice","strIngredient16":"garlic","strIngredient17":"clove","strIngredient18":"cinnamon","strIngredient19":"tomatoes","strIngredient20":"","strMeasure1":"2 tbsp","strMeasure2":"4cm piece finely chopped","strMeasure3":"2 cloves peeled and chopped","strMeasure4":"800g peeled and chopped ","strMeasure5":"2 tbsp","strMeasure6":"1 tsp","strMeasure7":"50","strMeasure8":"1 large","strMeasure9":"400g","strMeasure10":"1 medium","strMeasure11":"1 small peeled and coarsely grated","strMeasure12":"2 tbsp","strMeasure13":"2 tbsp","strMeasure14":"2 tbsp chopped","strMeasure15":"1 tbsp","strMeasure16":"2 cloves","strMeasure17":"½ tsp ground","strMeasure18":"½ tsp ground ","strMeasure19":"2 medium","strMeasure20":"","strSource":"http://www.ottolenghi.co.uk/recipes/meat/lamb-tomato-and-sweet-spices-shop","strImageSource":null,"strCreativeCommonsConfirmed":null,"dateModified":null},{"idMeal":"52805","strMeal":"Lamb Biryani","strMealAlternate":null,"strCategory":"Lamb","strArea":"Indian","strInstructions":"Grind the cashew, poppy seeds and cumin seeds into a smooth paste, using as little water as possible.

The fried onion will crisp up as it drains. Also fry the cashewnuts till golden brown. Set aside.\r\n\r\nWash the rice and soak in water for twenty minutes.\r\nMeanwhile, take a big wide pan, add oil in medium heat, add the sliced onions, add the blended paste, to it add the green chillies, ginger garlic paste and garlic and fry for a minute.\r\nThen add the tomatoes and sauté them well till they are cooked and not mushy.\r\n\r\nThen to it add the red chilli powder, biryani powder, mint, coriander leaves and sauté them well.\r\nAdd the yogurt and mix well.

When it is boiling high, add the rice, salt and jeera and mix well. After 7 minutes exact or when the rice is 80% done. Switch off and drain the rice.\r\n\r\nNow, the layering starts. To the lamb, pat and level it. Add the drained hot rice on the top of it.

If you are cooking in oven, do make sure to cook in a big oven safe pan and cover it tight and then keep in oven for the final step.\r\n2. You can skip biryani masala if you don’t have and add just garam masala (1 tsp and red chilli powder – 3 tsp instead of 1 tsp)\r\n3.

Leave for about 30 mins until cool and well-soaked, then mash a bit with a fork. Stir in the vanilla extract. Butter and flour seven mini pudding tins (each about 200ml/7fl oz) and sit them on a baking sheet. Heat oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4.\r\nWhile the dates are soaking, make the puddings. Mix the flour and bicarbonate of soda together and beat the eggs in a separate bowl. Beat the butter and sugar together in a large bowl for a few mins until slightly creamy (the mixture will be grainy from the sugar). Add the eggs a little at a time, beating well between additions. Beat in the black treacle then, using a large metal spoon, gently fold in one-third of the flour, then half the milk, being careful not to overbeat. Repeat until all the flour and milk is used. Stir the soaked dates into the pudding batter. The mix may look a little curdled at this point and will be like a soft, thick batter. Spoon it evenly between the tins and bake for 20-25 mins, until risen and firm.\r\nMeanwhile, put the sugar and butter for the sauce in a medium saucepan with half the cream. Bring to the boil over a medium heat, stirring all the time, until the sugar has completely dissolved. Stir in the black treacle, turn up the heat slightly and let the mixture bubble away for 2-3 mins until it is a rich toffee colour, stirring occasionally to make sure it doesn’t burn. Take the pan off the heat and beat in the rest of the cream.\r\nRemove the puddings from the oven. Leave in the tins for a few mins, then loosen them well from the sides of the tins with a small palette knife before turning them out. You can serve them now with the sauce drizzled over, but they’ll be even stickier if left for a day or two coated in the sauce. To do this, pour about half the sauce into one or two ovenproof serving dishes. Sit the upturned puddings on the sauce, then pour the rest of the sauce over them. Cover with a loose tent of foil so that the sauce doesn’t smudge (no need to chill).\r\nWhen ready to serve, heat oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4. Warm the puddings through, still covered, for 15-20 mins or until the sauce is bubbling. Serve them on their own, or with cream or custard.","strMealThumb":"https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/xrptpq1483909204.jpg","strTags":"Pudding,Desert,Cake,Dairy","strYoutube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKq6RbxJHBo","strIngredient1":"Medjool dates","strIngredient2":"water","strIngredient3":"vanilla extract","strIngredient4":"self-raising flour","strIngredient5":"bicarbonate of soda","strIngredient6":"eggs","strIngredient7":"butter","strIngredient8":"demerara sugar","strIngredient9":"black treacle","strIngredient10":"milk","strIngredient11":"ice cream","strIngredient12":"muscovado sugar","strIngredient13":"butter","strIngredient14":"double cream","strIngredient15":"black treacle","strIngredient16":"","strIngredient17":"","strIngredient18":"","strIngredient19":"","strIngredient20":"","strMeasure1":"225g","strMeasure2":"175ml Boiling","strMeasure3":"1 tsp","strMeasure4":"175g","strMeasure5":"1 tsp","strMeasure6":"2","strMeasure7":"85g","strMeasure8":"140g","strMeasure9":"2 tbsp","strMeasure10":"100ml","strMeasure11":"1 scoop","strMeasure12":"175g","strMeasure13":"50g","strMeasure14":"225ml","strMeasure15":"1 tbsp","strMeasure16":"","strMeasure17":"","strMeasure18":"","strMeasure19":"","strMeasure20":"","strSource":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wytv3bjqJII","strImageSource":null,"strCreativeCommonsConfirmed":null,"dateModified":null},{"idMeal":"52797","strMeal":"Spicy North African Potato Salad","strMealAlternate":null,"strCategory":"Vegetarian","strArea":"Moroccan","strInstructions":"Cook potatoes - place potatoes in a pot of cold water, and bring to the boil.

Overlap two pieces of cling film in the middle of the bowl as it’s easier than trying to get one sheet to stick to all of the curves. Let the edges overhang by about 15cm. Cut the crusts off the bread. Cut 4 pieces of bread in half, a little on an angle, to give 2 lopsided rectangles per piece. Cut 2 slices into 4 triangles each and leave the final piece whole.\r\nBuild the pud: Dip the whole piece of bread into the juice for a few secs just to coat. Push this into the bottom of the basin. Now dip the wonky rectangular pieces one at a time and press around the basin’s sides so that they fit together neatly, alternately placing wide and narrow ends up. If you can’t quite fit the last piece of bread in it doesn’t matter, just trim into a triangle, dip in juice and slot in. Now spoon in the softened fruit, adding the strawberries here and there as you go.\r\nLet flavours mingle then serve: Dip the bread triangles in juice and place on top – trim off overhang with scissors. Keep leftover juice for later. Bring cling film up and loosely seal. Put a side plate on top and weight down with cans. Chill for 6 hrs or overnight. To serve, open out cling film then put a serving plate upside-down on top and flip over. serve with leftover juice, any extra berries and cream.","strMealThumb":"https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/rsqwus1511640214.jpg","strTags":"Summer","strYoutube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akJIO6UhXtA","strIngredient1":"Strawberries","strIngredient2":"Blackberries","strIngredient3":"Redcurrants","strIngredient4":"Raspberries","strIngredient5":"Caster Sugar","strIngredient6":"Bread","strIngredient7":"","strIngredient8":"","strIngredient9":"","strIngredient10":"","strIngredient11":"","strIngredient12":"","strIngredient13":"","strIngredient14":"","strIngredient15":"","strIngredient16":"","strIngredient17":"","strIngredient18":"","strIngredient19":"","strIngredient20":"","strMeasure1":"300g","strMeasure2":"250g","strMeasure3":"100g ","strMeasure4":"500g","strMeasure5":"175g","strMeasure6":"7 Slices","strMeasure7":"","strMeasure8":"","strMeasure9":"","strMeasure10":"","strMeasure11":"","strMeasure12":"","strMeasure13":"","strMeasure14":"","strMeasure15":"","strMeasure16":"","strMeasure17":"","strMeasure18":"","strMeasure19":"","strMeasure20":"","strSource":"https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/4516/summer-pudding","strImageSource":null,"strCreativeCommonsConfirmed":null,"dateModified":null},{"idMeal":"52911","strMeal":"Summer Pistou","strMealAlternate":null,"strCategory":"Vegetarian","strArea":"French","strInstructions":"Heat the oil in a large pan and fry the leeks and courgette for 5 mins to soften.

Add the butter and process until the mixture resembles coarse\r\n\r\nmeal (about 15 seconds). Pour 1/4 cup (60 ml) water in a slow, steady stream, through the feed tube until the dough just holds together when pinched. If necessary, add more water. Do not process more than 30 seconds.\r\nTurn the dough onto your work surface and gather into a ball. Divide the dough in half, flattening each half into a disk, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for about one hour before using. This will chill the butter and relax the gluten in the flour. \r\n\r\nAfter the dough has chilled sufficiently, remove one portion of the dough from the fridge and place it on a lightly floured surface.  Roll the pastry into a 12 inch (30 cm) circle. (To prevent the pastry from sticking to the counter and to ensure uniform thickness, keep lifting up and turning the pastry a quarter turn as you roll (always roll from the center of the pastry outwards).)  Fold the dough in half and gently transfer to a 9 inch (23 cm) pie pan. Brush off any excess flour and trim any overhanging pastry to an edge of 1/2 inch (1.5 cm). Refrigerate the pastry, covered with plastic wrap, while you make the filling. \r\n\r\nRemove the second round of pastry and roll it into a 13 inch (30 cm) circle. Using a pastry wheel or pizza cutter, cut the pastry into about 3/4 inch (2 cm) strips. Place the strips of pastry on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and place in the refrigerator for about 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nMake the Strawberry Rhubarb Filling: Place the cut strawberries and rhubarb in a large bowl. In a small bowl mix together the cornstarch, sugar, and ground cinnamon. \r\n\r\nRemove the chilled pie crust from the fridge. Sprinkle about 2 tablespoons of the sugar mixture over the bottom of the pastry crust. Add the remaining sugar mixture to the strawberries and rhubarb and gently toss to combine. Pour the fruit mixture into the prepared pie shell. Sprinkle the fruit with about 1 teaspoon of lemon juice and dot with 2 tablespoons of butter.\r\n\r\nRemove the lattice pastry from the refrigerator and, starting at the center with the longest strips and working outwards, place half the strips, spacing about 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart, on top of the filling. (Use the shortest pastry strips at the outer edges.) Then, gently fold back, about halfway, every other strip of pastry. Take another strip of pastry and place it perpendicular on top of the first strips of pastry. Unfold the bottom strips of pastry and then fold back the strips that weren't folded back the first time. Lay another strip of pastry perpendicular on top of the filling and then continue with the remaining strips. Trim the edges of the pastry strips, leaving a 1 inch (2.5 cm) overhang. Seal the edges of the pastry strips by folding them under the bottom pastry crust and flute the edges of the pastry. Brush the lattice pastry with milk and sprinkle with a little sugar. Cover and place in the refrigerator while you preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) and place the oven rack in the lower third of the oven. Put a baking sheet, lined with aluminum foil, on the oven rack (to catch any spills.)\r\n\r\nPlace the pie plate on the hot baking sheet and bake the pie for about 35 minutes and then, if the edges of the pie are browning too much, cover with a foil ring. Continue to bake the pie for about another 10 minutes or until the crust is a golden brown color and the fruit juices begin to bubble.\r\n\r\nRemove the pie from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool for several hours. Serve at room temperature with softly whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for about 3 days. Reheat before serving. This pie can be frozen.\r\n\r\nMakes one 9 inch (23 cm) pie.","strMealThumb":"https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/178z5o1585514569.jpg","strTags":"Pudding,Pie,Baking,Fruity,Glazed","strYoutube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGw5Pwm4YA0","strIngredient1":"Flour","strIngredient2":"Salt","strIngredient3":"Sugar","strIngredient4":"Butter","strIngredient5":"Water","strIngredient6":"Rhubarb","strIngredient7":"Strawberries","strIngredient8":"Cornstarch","strIngredient9":"Sugar","strIngredient10":"Cinnamon","strIngredient11":"Lemon Juice","strIngredient12":"Unsalted Butter","strIngredient13":"Milk","strIngredient14":"Sugar","strIngredient15":"","strIngredient16":"","strIngredient17":"","strIngredient18":"","strIngredient19":"","strIngredient20":"","strMeasure1":"350g","strMeasure2":"1 tsp ","strMeasure3":"2 tbs","strMeasure4":"1 cup ","strMeasure5":"1/2 cup ","strMeasure6":"450g","strMeasure7":"450g","strMeasure8":"3 tbs","strMeasure9":"150g","strMeasure10":"1/4 tsp","strMeasure11":"1 tsp ","strMeasure12":"2 tbs","strMeasure13":"2 tbs","strMeasure14":"Spinkling","strMeasure15":" ","strMeasure16":" ","strMeasure17":" ","strMeasure18":" ","strMeasure19":" ","strMeasure20":" ","strSource":"https://www.joyofbaking.com/StrawberryRhubarbPie.html","strImageSource":null,"strCreativeCommonsConfirmed":null,"dateModified":null},{"idMeal":"53008","strMeal":"Stuffed Lamb Tomatoes","strMealAlternate":null,"strCategory":"Lamb","strArea":"Greek","strInstructions":"Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.

Get a small square of cling film and place a topping, like half a prawn or a small piece of smoked salmon, on it. Use damp hands to roll walnut-sized balls of rice and place on the topping.\r\n\r\nSTEP 11\r\nMake into tight balls.

I tossed out the water they were soaked in after it did the job.\r\n\r\nHave your butcher cut the salted pigtail into 2 inch pieces as it will be very difficult to cut with an ordinary kitchen knife. Wash, then place a deep pot with water and bring to a boil. Cook for 20 minutes, then drain + rinse and repeat (boil again in water). The goal is to make the pieces of pig tails tender and to remove most of the salt it was cured in.\r\n\r\nTime to start the soup. Place everything in the pot (except the flour and potato), then cover with water and place on a high flame to bring to a boil. As it comes to a boil, skim off any scum/froth at the top and discard. Reduce the heat to a gentle boil and allow it to cook for 1 hr and 15 mins.. basically until the beans are tender and start falling apart.\r\n\r\nIt’s now time to add the potato (and Yams etc if you’re adding it) as well as the coconut milk and continue cooking for 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nNow is a good time to start making the basic dough for the spinner dumplings.

However you can taste and adjust accordingly. Lets recap the timing part of things so you’re not confused. Cook the base of the soup for 1 hr and 15 minute or until tender, then add the potatoes and cook for 15 minutes, then add the dumplings and cook for a further 15 minutes. Keep in mind that this soup will thicken quite a bit as it cools.\r\n\r\nWhile this is not a traditional recipe to any one specific island, versions of this soup (sometimes called stewed peas) can be found throughout the Caribbean, Latin America and Africa. A hearty bowl of this soup will surely give you the sleepies (some may call it ethnic fatigue). You can certainly freeze the leftovers and heat it up another day.","strMealThumb":"https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/sqpqtp1515365614.jpg","strTags":"Soup,SideDish","strYoutube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ogCfDXotMw","strIngredient1":"Kidney Beans","strIngredient2":"Carrots","strIngredient3":"Spring Onions","strIngredient4":"Thyme","strIngredient5":"Onion","strIngredient6":"Black Pepper","strIngredient7":"Red Pepper","strIngredient8":"Garlic Clove","strIngredient9":"Allspice","strIngredient10":"Beef","strIngredient11":"Water","strIngredient12":"Potatoes","strIngredient13":"Plain Flour","strIngredient14":"Water","strIngredient15":"Coconut Milk","strIngredient16":"","strIngredient17":"","strIngredient18":"","strIngredient19":"","strIngredient20":"","strMeasure1":"2 cups ","strMeasure2":"1 large","strMeasure3":"2 chopped","strMeasure4":"4 sprigs","strMeasure5":"1 Diced","strMeasure6":"1/2 tsp","strMeasure7":"2 chopped","strMeasure8":"4 Mashed","strMeasure9":"1 tbs","strMeasure10":"2 Lbs","strMeasure11":"2L","strMeasure12":"4","strMeasure13":"1 cup ","strMeasure14":"1/4 cup","strMeasure15":"1 cup ","strMeasure16":"","strMeasure17":"","strMeasure18":"","strMeasure19":"","strMeasure20":"","strSource":"http://caribbeanpot.com/caribbean-red-peas-soup/","strImageSource":null,"strCreativeCommonsConfirmed":null,"dateModified":null},{"idMeal":"52942","strMeal":"Roast fennel and aubergine paella","strMealAlternate":null,"strCategory":"Vegan","strArea":"Spanish","strInstructions":"1 Put the fennel, aubergine, pepper and courgette in a roasting tray.

Begin to puree, slowly adding about 1/2 cup fresh water, until a creamy consistency is reached. You may need to add less or more water to reach the desired consistency.\r\nAdd a pinch of sea salt and vinegar (or lemon juice).","strMealThumb":"https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/uwxqwy1483389553.jpg","strTags":"Pulse","strYoutube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKmqawK2Tqs","strIngredient1":"Olive Oil","strIngredient2":"Onion","strIngredient3":"Leek","strIngredient4":"Garlic","strIngredient5":"Cumin","strIngredient6":"Coriander","strIngredient7":"Smoked Paprika","strIngredient8":"Cinnamon","strIngredient9":"Chili Powder","strIngredient10":"Cocoa","strIngredient11":"Dried Oregano","strIngredient12":"Diced Tomatoes","strIngredient13":"Water","strIngredient14":"Carrots","strIngredient15":"Brown Lentils","strIngredient16":"Sea Salt","strIngredient17":"Squash","strIngredient18":"Cashews","strIngredient19":"Apple Cider Vinegar","strIngredient20":"","strMeasure1":"1 tbls","strMeasure2":"1","strMeasure3":"1 chopped","strMeasure4":"3 cloves","strMeasure5":"4 tsp ground ","strMeasure6":"2 tsp ground","strMeasure7":"1 tsp","strMeasure8":"1/2 tsp","strMeasure9":"1 tsp","strMeasure10":"1 tsp","strMeasure11":"1/2 tsp","strMeasure12":"1 can","strMeasure13":"3 cups","strMeasure14":"3 chopped","strMeasure15":"1 1/2 cups","strMeasure16":"1 tsp","strMeasure17":"1 Small","strMeasure18":"1 Cup","strMeasure19":"1 tsp","strMeasure20":"","strSource":"http://www.wholeheartedeats.com/2016/11/smoky-lentil-chili-squash/","strImageSource":null,"strCreativeCommonsConfirmed":null,"dateModified":null},{"idMeal":"52793","strMeal":"Sticky Toffee Pudding Ultimate","strMealAlternate":null,"strCategory":"Dessert","strArea":"British","strInstructions":"Stone and chop the dates quite small, put them in a bowl, then pour the boiling water over. Leave for about 30 mins until cool and well-soaked, then mash a bit with a fork. Stir in the vanilla extract. Butter and flour seven mini pudding tins (each about 200ml/7fl oz) and sit them on a baking sheet. Heat oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4.\r\nWhile the dates are soaking, make the puddings. Mix the flour and bicarbonate of soda together and beat the eggs in a separate bowl. Beat the butter and sugar together in a large bowl for a few mins until slightly creamy (the mixture will be grainy from the sugar). Add the eggs a little at a time, beating well between additions. Beat in the black treacle then, using a large metal spoon, gently fold in one-third of the flour, then half the milk, being careful not to overbeat. Repeat until all the flour and milk is used. Stir the soaked dates into the pudding batter. The mix may look a little curdled at this point and will be like a soft, thick batter. Spoon it evenly between the tins and bake for 20-25 mins, until risen and firm.\r\nMeanwhile, put the sugar and butter for the sauce in a medium saucepan with half the cream. Bring to the boil over a medium heat, stirring all the time, until the sugar has completely dissolved. Stir in the black treacle, turn up the heat slightly and let the mixture bubble away for 2-3 mins until it is a rich toffee colour, stirring occasionally to make sure it doesn’t burn. Take the pan off the heat and beat in the rest of the cream.\r\nRemove the puddings from the oven. Leave in the tins for a few mins, then loosen them well from the sides of the tins with a small palette knife before turning them out. You can serve them now with the sauce drizzled over, but they’ll be even stickier if left for a day or two coated in the sauce. To do this, pour about half the sauce into one or two ovenproof serving dishes. Sit the upturned puddings on the sauce, then pour the rest of the sauce over them. Cover with a loose tent of foil so that the sauce doesn’t smudge (no need to chill).\r\nWhen ready to serve, heat oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4. Warm the puddings through, still covered, for 15-20 mins or until the sauce is bubbling. Serve them on their own, or with cream or custard.","strMealThumb":"https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/xrptpq1483909204.jpg","strTags":"Pudding,Desert,Cake,Dairy","strYoutube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKq6RbxJHBo","strIngredient1":"Medjool dates","strIngredient2":"water","strIngredient3":"vanilla extract","strIngredient4":"self-raising flour","strIngredient5":"bicarbonate of soda","strIngredient6":"eggs","strIngredient7":"butter","strIngredient8":"demerara sugar","strIngredient9":"black treacle","strIngredient10":"milk","strIngredient11":"ice cream","strIngredient12":"muscovado sugar","strIngredient13":"butter","strIngredient14":"double cream","strIngredient15":"black treacle","strIngredient16":"","strIngredient17":"","strIngredient18":"","strIngredient19":"","strIngredient20":"","strMeasure1":"225g","strMeasure2":"175ml Boiling","strMeasure3":"1 tsp","strMeasure4":"175g","strMeasure5":"1 tsp","strMeasure6":"2","strMeasure7":"85g","strMeasure8":"140g","strMeasure9":"2 tbsp","strMeasure10":"100ml","strMeasure11":"1 scoop","strMeasure12":"175g","strMeasure13":"50g","strMeasure14":"225ml","strMeasure15":"1 tbsp","strMeasure16":"","strMeasure17":"","strMeasure18":"","strMeasure19":"","strMeasure20":"","strSource":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wytv3bjqJII","strImageSource":null,"strCreativeCommonsConfirmed":null,"dateModified":null},{"idMeal":"52797","strMeal":"Spicy North African Potato Salad","strMealAlternate":null,"strCategory":"Vegetarian","strArea":"Moroccan","strInstructions":"Cook potatoes - place potatoes in a pot of cold water, and bring to the boil.

If you can’t quite fit the last piece of bread in it doesn’t matter, just trim into a triangle, dip in juice and slot in. Now spoon in the softened fruit, adding the strawberries here and there as you go.\r\nLet flavours mingle then serve: Dip the bread triangles in juice and place on top – trim off overhang with scissors. Keep leftover juice for later. Bring cling film up and loosely seal. Put a side plate on top and weight down with cans. Chill for 6 hrs or overnight.

Add the butter and process until the mixture resembles coarse\r\n\r\nmeal (about 15 seconds). Pour 1/4 cup (60 ml) water in a slow, steady stream, through the feed tube until the dough just holds together when pinched. If necessary, add more water. Do not process more than 30 seconds.\r\nTurn the dough onto your work surface and gather into a ball. Divide the dough in half, flattening each half into a disk, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for about one hour before using. This will chill the butter and relax the gluten in the flour. \r\n\r\nAfter the dough has chilled sufficiently, remove one portion of the dough from the fridge and place it on a lightly floured surface.  Roll the pastry into a 12 inch (30 cm) circle. (To prevent the pastry from sticking to the counter and to ensure uniform thickness, keep lifting up and turning the pastry a quarter turn as you roll (always roll from the center of the pastry outwards).)  Fold the dough in half and gently transfer to a 9 inch (23 cm) pie pan. Brush off any excess flour and trim any overhanging pastry to an edge of 1/2 inch (1.5 cm). Refrigerate the pastry, covered with plastic wrap, while you make the filling. \r\n\r\nRemove the second round of pastry and roll it into a 13 inch (30 cm) circle. Using a pastry wheel or pizza cutter, cut the pastry into about 3/4 inch (2 cm) strips. Place the strips of pastry on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and place in the refrigerator for about 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nMake the Strawberry Rhubarb Filling: Place the cut strawberries and rhubarb in a large bowl. In a small bowl mix together the cornstarch, sugar, and ground cinnamon. \r\n\r\nRemove the chilled pie crust from the fridge. Sprinkle about 2 tablespoons of the sugar mixture over the bottom of the pastry crust. Add the remaining sugar mixture to the strawberries and rhubarb and gently toss to combine. Pour the fruit mixture into the prepared pie shell. Sprinkle the fruit with about 1 teaspoon of lemon juice and dot with 2 tablespoons of butter.\r\n\r\nRemove the lattice pastry from the refrigerator and, starting at the center with the longest strips and working outwards, place half the strips, spacing about 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart, on top of the filling. (Use the shortest pastry strips at the outer edges.) Then, gently fold back, about halfway, every other strip of pastry. Take another strip of pastry and place it perpendicular on top of the first strips of pastry. Unfold the bottom strips of pastry and then fold back the strips that weren't folded back the first time. Lay another strip of pastry perpendicular on top of the filling and then continue with the remaining strips. Trim the edges of the pastry strips, leaving a 1 inch (2.5 cm) overhang. Seal the edges of the pastry strips by folding them under the bottom pastry crust and flute the edges of the pastry. Brush the lattice pastry with milk and sprinkle with a little sugar. Cover and place in the refrigerator while you preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) and place the oven rack in the lower third of the oven. Put a baking sheet, lined with aluminum foil, on the oven rack (to catch any spills.)\r\n\r\nPlace the pie plate on the hot baking sheet and bake the pie for about 35 minutes and then, if the edges of the pie are browning too much, cover with a foil ring. Continue to bake the pie for about another 10 minutes or until the crust is a golden brown color and the fruit juices begin to bubble.\r\n\r\nRemove the pie from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool for several hours. Serve at room temperature with softly whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for about 3 days. Reheat before serving. This pie can be frozen.\r\n\r\nMakes one 9 inch (23 cm) pie.","strMealThumb":"https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/178z5o1585514569.jpg","strTags":"Pudding,Pie,Baking,Fruity,Glazed","strYoutube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGw5Pwm4YA0","strIngredient1":"Flour","strIngredient2":"Salt","strIngredient3":"Sugar","strIngredient4":"Butter","strIngredient5":"Water","strIngredient6":"Rhubarb","strIngredient7":"Strawberries","strIngredient8":"Cornstarch","strIngredient9":"Sugar","strIngredient10":"Cinnamon","strIngredient11":"Lemon Juice","strIngredient12":"Unsalted Butter","strIngredient13":"Milk","strIngredient14":"Sugar","strIngredient15":"","strIngredient16":"","strIngredient17":"","strIngredient18":"","strIngredient19":"","strIngredient20":"","strMeasure1":"350g","strMeasure2":"1 tsp ","strMeasure3":"2 tbs","strMeasure4":"1 cup ","strMeasure5":"1/2 cup ","strMeasure6":"450g","strMeasure7":"450g","strMeasure8":"3 tbs","strMeasure9":"150g","strMeasure10":"1/4 tsp","strMeasure11":"1 tsp ","strMeasure12":"2 tbs","strMeasure13":"2 tbs","strMeasure14":"Spinkling","strMeasure15":" ","strMeasure16":" ","strMeasure17":" ","strMeasure18":" ","strMeasure19":" ","strMeasure20":" ","strSource":"https://www.joyofbaking.com/StrawberryRhubarbPie.html","strImageSource":null,"strCreativeCommonsConfirmed":null,"dateModified":null},{"idMeal":"53008","strMeal":"Stuffed Lamb Tomatoes","strMealAlternate":null,"strCategory":"Lamb","strArea":"Greek","strInstructions":"Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.

Lay a nori sheet on the mat, shiny-side down. Dip your hands in the vinegared water, then pat handfuls of rice on top in a 1cm thick layer, leaving the furthest edge from you clear.\r\n\r\nSTEP 2\r\nSpread over some Japanese mayonnaise. Use a spoon to spread out a thin layer of mayonnaise down the middle of the rice.\r\n\r\nSTEP 3\r\nAdd the filling. Get your child to top the mayonnaise with a line of their favourite fillings – here we’ve used tuna and cucumber.\r\n\r\nSTEP 4\r\nRoll it up. Lift the edge of the mat over the rice, applying a little pressure to keep everything in a tight roll.\r\n\r\nSTEP 5\r\nStick down the sides like a stamp. When you get to the edge without any rice, brush with a little water and continue to roll into a tight roll.\r\n\r\nSTEP 6\r\nWrap in cling film.

Line a loaf tin with cling film, then place a thin layer of smoked salmon inside on top of the cling film.\r\n\r\nSTEP 8\r\nCover with rice and press down. Press about 3cm of rice over the fish, fold the cling film over and press down as much as you can, using another tin if you have one.\r\n\r\nSTEP 9\r\nTip it out like a sandcastle. Turn block of sushi onto a chopping board. Get a grown-up to cut into fingers, then remove the cling film.\r\n\r\nSTEP 10\r\nTO MAKE SUSHI BALLS: Choose your topping. Get a small square of cling film and place a topping, like half a prawn or a small piece of smoked salmon, on it. Use damp hands to roll walnut-sized balls of rice and place on the topping.\r\n\r\nSTEP 11\r\nMake into tight balls.

Add about three tablespoons of cold water and mix to a firm dough, wrap in cling film and chill in the fridge for about 20 minutes.\r\nPreheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6 and put a heavy baking tray in the oven to heat up. Grease a deep 18cm/7in loose-bottomed fluted flan tin with butter.\r\nRemove about 150g/5½oz of pastry from the main ball and set aside for the lattice top.\r\nRoll the rest of the pastry out thinly on a lightly floured work surface and line the prepared flan tin with the pastry.\r\nPrick the base with a fork, to stop the base rising up during baking.\r\nPlace the reserved pastry for the lattice top on cling film and roll out thinly. Egg wash the pastry and set aside to chill in the fridge (the cling film makes it easier to move about). Do not cut into strips at this stage. Do not egg wash the strips once they are on the tart as it will drip into the treacle mixture.\r\nTo make the filling, heat the syrup gently in a large pan but do not boil.\r\nOnce melted, add the breadcrumbs, lemon juice and zest to the syrup. (You can add less lemon if you would prefer less citrus taste.) If the mixture looks runny, add a few more breadcrumbs.\r\nPour the syrup mixture into the lined tin and level the surface.\r\nRemove the reserved pastry from the fridge and cut into long strips, 1cm/½in wide. Make sure they are all longer than the edges of the tart tin.\r\nEgg wash the edge of the pastry in the tin, and start to make the woven laying lattice pattern over the mixture, leave the strips hanging over the edge of the tin.\r\nOnce the lattice is in place, use the tin edge to cut off the strips by pressing down with your hands, creating a neat finish.\r\nBake on the pre-heated baking tray in the hot oven for about 10 minutes until the pastry has started to colour, and then reduce the oven temperature to 180C/350F/Gas 4. If at this stage the lattice seems to be getting too dark brown, cover the tart with tin foil.\r\nBake for a further 25-30 minutes until the pastry is golden-brown and the filling set.\r\nRemove the tart from the oven and leave to firm up in the tin.
